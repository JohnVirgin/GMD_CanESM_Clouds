# GMD_CanESM_Clouds
 A collection of post-processing and plotting scripts used in the study:

Virgin, J. G., Fletcher, C. G., Cole, J. N., von Salzen, K., & Mitovski, T. (2021). Cloud Feedbacks from CanESM2 to CanESM5. 0 and their influence on climate sensitivity. Geoscientific Model Development, 14(9), 5355-5372.

# Notes
 Post processing scripts require raw model output from the ESGF, as well as standard and cloud radiative kernels (see manuscript for details). Hard coded paths will aslo need editing.
