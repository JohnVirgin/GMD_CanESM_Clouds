# GMD_CanESM_Clouds
 A collection of post-processing and plotting scripts used in the study:

 Virgin, J. G., Fletcher, C. G., Cole, J. N. S., Von Salzen, K., and Mitovski, T. (2021). Cloud Feedbacks from CanESM2 to CanESM5 and their Influence on Climate Sensitivity. Manuscript submitted to Geophysical Model Development.

# Notes
 Post processing scripts require raw model output from the ESGF, as well as standard and cloud radiative kernels (see manuscript for details). Hard coded paths will aslo need editing.
